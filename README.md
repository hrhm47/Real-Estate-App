# Welcome to Real Estate app ðŸ‘‹

This is a hobby and learning project where I built a full-stack real estate application using React Native. The app features Google authentication, dynamic property listings, and user profiles â€” designed with modern tools for a seamless and scalable experience.

Built using:

- Expo SDK 52

- Appwrite (Backend as a Service)

- Tailwind CSS

- TypeScript

## Features 
- Authentication with Google: Secure and seamless user sign-ins using Googleâ€™s authentication service.
- Home Page: Displays the latest and recommended properties with powerful search and filter functionality.

- Explore Page: Allows users to browse all types of properties with a clean and intuitive interface.

- Property Details Page: Provides comprehensive information about individual properties, including images and key details.

- Profile Page: Customizable user settings and profile management

- Centralized Data Fetching: Custom-built solution inspired by TanStackâ€™s useQuery for efficient API calls.

- and many more, including code architecture and reusability


### Credits
